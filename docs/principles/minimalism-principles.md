The 10 principles of minimalism:

1. Priorities have to be set
2. Trends are temporary, timelessness is the way to go
3. Purchases are made intentionally, not spontaneously
4. Minimalists replace instead of upgrading
5. Money is a means to an end, not a goal in itself
6. Your job and leisure activities don’t matter, your attitude towards them does
7. When it comes to design, minimalists seek a combination of beauty and functionality
8. Physical and mental wellbeing is a requirement, not an option
9. When it comes to relationships, quality is valued over quantity
10. Less is more but “less” is a flexible concept
