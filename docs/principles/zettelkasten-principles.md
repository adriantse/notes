# Zettelkasten principles

- **atomicity**: each note should contain one idea and one idea only. This makes it possible to link ideas with a laser focus.

- **autonomy**: self-contained and comprehensible on its own. This allows notes to be moved, processed, separated, and concatenated independently of its neighbors.

- **link your notes**: A note that is not connected to the network will be lost, will be forgotten.

- **Use your own words**: Don’t copy and paste - express that idea with your own words, in a way that you’ll be sure to understand years later.

- **Keep references**: makes it easy for you to revisit the original source later on.

  - [ ] setup default tempplates for reference section

- Don’t worry about structure: The organization develops organically.

  - [ ] tagging possible in mkdocs?

- **Never delete**: Don’t delete old notes. Instead, link to new notes that explain what’s wrong with the old ones.

- Add notes without fear: You can never have too much information in your Zettelkasten. At worst, you’ll add notes that won’t be of immediate use.
